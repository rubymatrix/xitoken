# xitoken — short-lived signed tokens between POL providers and FFXI worlds

Version 1. This document is normative; the C# (`dotnet/`) and C++ (`cpp/`) libraries are reference
implementations, and `vectors/` holds the test vectors every implementation must pass.

## Why

Today a world trusts a lobby because the lobby can write `accounts_sessions` rows into the world's database.
That does not work once worlds are run by different operators. Instead, the **provider** (the POL service the
player signed in to: auth + lobby, e.g. Project Crystal) hands a **world** a token that says, signed with the
provider's key, "this player, on this world, for the next minute". The world checks the signature with the
provider's public key and never shares a database or a secret with it.

| role | does | holds |
|---|---|---|
| provider | authenticates players, issues tokens | an identity key, and the signing keys it endorses |
| world | verifies tokens, admits players | an identity key (for its id), and the provider ids it chose to trust |

## Server ids

Every server — provider or world — has a long-lived Ed25519 **identity key**. Its **server id** is derived from
the identity public key, so ids are globally unique without a registry, and only the key's holder can speak for
an id:

    server id = "xi1." + base64url( SHA-256( "xitoken server id" || 0x00 || identity_public_key )[0..16] )

That is `xi1.` followed by 22 characters, for example `xi1.3q2-7wGHFgjEVK8bq0iNcw`.

* Tokens use server ids for `iss` (the provider) and `aud` (the world).
* A player's **global id** is `<provider server id>:<sub>`. For example, `xi1.3q2-7wGHFgjEVK8bq0iNcw:1001` is
  player `1001` at that provider. A server id never contains `:`, so the global id splits at the first `:`.
* Display names ("Crystal", "PhoenixPS2") are labels carried alongside the id. Nothing trusts them.
* The identity key only signs key sets, so it can be kept offline. Losing or replacing it means a new server id.

## Keys and key sets

* Secret keys are written as PASERK `k4.secret.<base64url(seed32 || public32)>`, public keys as
  `k4.public.<base64url(public32)>`.
* A server signs tokens with **signing keys**, each named by a **key id** (`kid`): 1–64 characters from
  `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`, unique within that server (for example `2026-10`).
* The server publishes its signing keys as a **signed key set**: a v4.public token signed by its identity key.

Footer:

```json
{ "idk": "k4.public.<identity public key>" }
```

Payload:

```json
{
  "typ": "xi.keyset/1",
  "iss": "xi1.3q2-7wGHFgjEVK8bq0iNcw",
  "name": "Crystal",
  "iat": "2026-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "keys": [ { "kid": "2026-10", "public": "k4.public.HrnbmBN..." } ]
}
```

`name` is optional. `exp` is optional; when it is present, the key set stops being accepted after it.

To load a key set, a world:

1. decodes `idk` and computes its server id;
2. checks the signature with `idk`;
3. checks that `typ` is `xi.keyset/1`, that `iss` equals the computed id, and that `iss` equals the id the operator
   chose to trust;
4. checks that every `kid` is valid and unique within the set.

Because the key set authenticates itself, it can be fetched from anywhere: a file, a web page, or a registry.
The trust decision is only the server id.

When a newer key set (later `iat`) for the same id is loaded, it replaces the older one.

Rotation: publish a key set with the new key added, wait for worlds to reload it, start signing with the new key,
then publish one without the old key once the longest token lifetime has passed. Revocation: publish a key set
without the key.

## Token format

A token is a [PASETO](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec) **v4.public** token (Ed25519):

    v4.public.<base64url(payload || signature)>.<base64url(footer)>

* Base64url without padding. A token is at most 8192 characters.
* No implicit assertion is used (empty string).
* **Footer** (required): `{"iss":"<server id>","kid":"<key id>"}`, at most 512 bytes. It is unauthenticated until
  the signature is checked; it is used only to pick the key.
* **Payload**: a UTF-8 JSON object, at most 32 levels deep, with no duplicate keys.

Implementations MUST pass `vectors/paseto-v4-public.json` (the upstream v4.public vectors) before anything else.

## Claims

All times are RFC 3339 strings. Issuers write `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`; verifiers accept any RFC 3339 offset and
fractional seconds (which they truncate).

| claim | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `iss` | yes | provider server id. MUST equal the id whose key set holds the signing key |
| `aud` | yes | world server id the token is for |
| `sub` | yes | the player's account id **at the provider** (string). `iss:sub` is the player's global id |
| `typ` | yes | token type, see below. A verifier only accepts the type it asked for |
| `jti` | yes | unique token id: at least 128 random bits, base64url (issuers use 22 chars = 16 bytes) |
| `iat` | yes | issued at |
| `exp` | yes | expires at. `exp - iat` MUST NOT exceed the verifier's maximum lifetime |
| `nbf` | no | not before |

Other claims belong to the token type.

### Verification

Run the steps in this order and stop at the first failure. The error names are the ones the libraries return.

1. Parse: `v4.public.` header, base64url, payload of at least 64 bytes, footer present with string `iss` and
   `kid` → else `malformed`.
2. Look up the footer's `(iss, kid)` among trusted key sets → else `unknown_key`.
3. Check the Ed25519 signature over `PAE("v4.public.", payload, footer, "")` → else `bad_signature`.
4. Decode the JSON payload and check that every required claim is present with the right type → else `bad_claims`.
5. Check that the payload's `iss` equals the key's server id → else `wrong_issuer`. This stops one provider's key
   from minting tokens in another provider's name.
6. Check that `aud` equals this world's id → else `wrong_audience`.
7. Check that `typ` equals the expected type → else `wrong_type`.
8. Time, with a clock skew allowance `s` (default 30 s):
   * `now + s < nbf` (when `nbf` is present) or `now + s < iat` → `not_yet_valid`
   * `now - s >= exp` → `expired`
   * `exp - iat > max_lifetime` (default 300 s) → `lifetime_too_long`
9. Consume `(iss, jti)` in the replay guard. If it was already used → `replayed`. Entries are kept until
   `exp + s`. A world with several processes MUST share one guard (for example a table with a primary key on
   `(iss, jti)`).

The replay step comes last so that invalid tokens cannot fill the guard.

## Token types

### `xi.world-entry/1` — admit a character to a world

Issued by the provider's lobby when the player picks a character. It is sent to the world before the client
connects to the map server. Recommended lifetime: **60 s**.

| claim | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `char` | object | `{"id": uint32, "name": string (optional)}`. The world's character id, which the lobby got from the world |
| `client` | object | `{"ip": dotted IPv4, "version": string ≤ 16, "expansions": uint32}`. Where the client will connect from, and its build (for consoles: `patch.ver` and the installed-expansion bits) |
| `skey` | string | base64url of the 20-byte map session key. The client derives its Blowfish key from it |

`skey` is a live secret. A world-entry token is signed, **not encrypted**, so it MUST only travel over a
confidential channel (TLS, or a loopback/private link). It MUST NOT be logged.

A world that accepts a world-entry token writes its own session row from these claims (in LSB terms, an
`accounts_sessions` row with `session_key`, `client_addr`, `client_version`, `client_expansions`). From that
point the map login is unchanged.

### `xi.account/1` — act for a signed-in player

For world APIs called on behalf of a player (list, create, delete or rename characters). It has no extra claims.
Recommended lifetime: **120 s**. The world maps the player's global id to its own account.

## World gateway API

A world accepts tokens over HTTPS (or plain HTTP on a loopback/private link):

    POST <gateway>/xi/v1/world-entry
    Content-Type: text/plain

    v4.public....

| status | body | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | `{"ok":true}` | session written; the client may connect to the map server |
| 400 | `{"ok":false,"error":"<error name>"}` | token rejected. Error names are the verification ones, plus `bad_entry` for invalid world-entry claims |
| 409 | `{"ok":false,"error":"<reason>"}` | token valid but the world refuses the entry (`unknown_character`, `already_logged_in`, `not_permitted`) |
| 503 | `{"ok":false,"error":"unavailable"}` | the world cannot take entries right now |

A world publishes its own signed key set (with no signing keys, if it signs nothing yet). That lets providers
learn and check its server id and name the same way worlds check providers.
